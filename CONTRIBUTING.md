python3 gcp_master_assessment.py --help
```

#### Code Standards
- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Documentation**: Add docstrings for new functions and classes
- **Error Handling**: Include comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Testing**: Test with different GCP environments when possible

#### Pull Request Process
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch from `main`
3. **Make** your changes with clear, descriptive commits
4. **Test** your changes thoroughly
5. **Update** documentation if needed
6. **Submit** a pull request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference to related issues
   - Testing details

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing
- Test with different assessment scopes (project, folder, organization)
- Verify CSV output format and data accuracy
- Test error handling with invalid inputs
- Check performance with large datasets

### Automated Testing
- All scripts should pass syntax validation
- Help commands should work without errors
- Consider adding unit tests for new functions

## üìù Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Include parameter descriptions and return values
- Document any GCP API dependencies

### User Documentation
- Update relevant documentation files in `docs/`
- Add examples for new features
- Update the main README if needed

## üîß Development Areas

### High Priority
- **Performance optimization** for large organizations
- **Enhanced error handling** and recovery
- **Additional GCP services** (Cloud SQL, BigQuery, etc.)
- **Cost estimation** features

### Medium Priority
- **Data visualization** capabilities
- **Report templates** for different use cases
- **Integration** with other tools (Terraform, etc.)
- **Historical tracking** and trend analysis

### Low Priority
- **GUI interface** for non-technical users
- **Cloud deployment** options
- **Multi-cloud** support

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep service-specific code in separate files
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Follow the existing project structure

### Performance Considerations
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Use parallel processing appropriately
- Handle large datasets efficiently
- Provide progress indicators for long operations

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit credentials or sensitive data
- Use least-privilege IAM roles
- Validate all user inputs
- Log security-relevant events

## üêõ Bug Reports

### Information to Include
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, gcloud version
- **Command**: Exact command that failed
- **Error**: Complete error message and stack trace
- **Logs**: Relevant log file contents
- **Scope**: Organization size and complexity
- **Expected vs Actual**: What you expected vs what happened

### Example Bug Report
```
**Environment:**
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04
- Python: 3.9.7
- gcloud: 456.0.0

**Command:**
python3 gcp_master_assessment.py --org-id 123456789012 --parallel

**Error:**
Permission denied when accessing project xyz-project

**Expected:**
Should skip inaccessible projects and continue

**Logs:**
[Include relevant log entries]
```
